### Coding guidelines
[Ada Quality and Style Guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Style_Guide).
Focus must be put on readability and maintainability.

##### Exceptions
1. Do not put with-clauses and use-clauses on the same line. Rationale: If a
   use clause is removed it's easier to spot the removal in "diffs".

version numbers on releases.

Not decided yet (January 2014).
